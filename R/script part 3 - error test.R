# USSG indicated correctly in their GitHub that following computation fails.
NewAlph(4, mA=7, mB=10, N=20)$AlphMLE
# Error in pFNCHypergeo(t, mA, N - mA, mB, exp(alp[i])) :
#   Inconsistency. mean = 16, lower limit = 0, upper limit = 7

# USSG used this function from supplementary material of our Science Advances paper.
# The source of this error was the BiasedUrn package that we used for various computations of Extended Hypergeometric
# (also called Fisher noncentral hypergeometric) distribution.
# We did not encounter this problem while analyzing data for our Science Advances paper (Mainali et al., 2022).
# This problem from the BiasedUrn package was later resolved in our package revision on July 12, 2022.
# When USSG published their commentary in October 2022, the package had resolved this problem for several months.
# see below:
ML.Alpha(4, c(7, 10, 20))


# USSG provided R code that iterates through various combination of input values
# to check the stability of our function available as supplement to Science Advances paper.
# We performed ten runs of their code (with some corrections) simulating input data for 100K times in each run.
# We found that the indicated error happened 5-13 times in 100,000 input values.
# In the run that we saved, this problem happened 7 times.

# As we show below, our package function does NOT fail for those input values.
