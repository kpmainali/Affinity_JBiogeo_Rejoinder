#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# First of all, note that the Number of Sites on the x-axes of Fig1(a) and of Fig1(c) of USSG commentary mean somewhat different things.
# In Fig.1(a), the number of sites is simply the table-total N in the 2x2 species-pair contingency table of occurrences,
# i.e., the total number of ecologic sites at which occurrence of species A and B are recorded.
# On the other hand, in Fig.1(c), the number of sites is explained in text to be the total number of distinct sites occupied by at least one species.
# That is, in the 2x2 table notation where X is the number of co-occurrences, mA and mB the total numbers of sites
# at which respectively species A and species B are finite, the number of occupied sites is mA + mB - X.
# The number of co-occurrences is subtracted to avoid double-counting of sites occupied by both species among mA + mB.

# Now we know that when mA, mB and N are fixed, Affinity is an increasing function of X.
# Therefore, if a dataset of 2x2 tables is generated by fixing species prevalences mA, mB,
# and total number N of examined ecologic sites and generating co-occurrence counts X independently
# from the Extended Hypergeometric distribution, we should expect that Affinity and Number of Occupied Sites
# will show a definite negative correlation and no particular curvature.
# On the other hand, real ecologic datasets consist of 2x2 tables for all species-pairs among the species
# examined at the ecologic sites in a specific geographic location.
# These species have joint occurrences governed by complicated biological processes
# and so the (Affinity, Number of Occupied Sites) data-pairs generated from all species-pairs should by no means be assumed independent.
# The patterns of correlation or curvature in plots like Fig.1(c) cannot be validly analyzed using least-squares and p-values
# for coefficients computed as though these points were independent.

# The artificial X-data used to create the figures plotting Affinity versus p_gt or versus Xstd
# was also not a set of points generated according to the assumptions underlying linear-regression software.
# The X's in those figures were generated as Extended-Hypergeometric medians with fixed values of mA,mB,N,
# and 4 different alpha's. As we show below, linear-regression to fit
# quadratic curves to Affinity versus Number of Occupied Sites non-significant and/or meaningless (close to zero) curvature.
# This is still an artifact of the (nonstochastic!) way the points were generated.
# Contrast this with the corresponding plots when the X values are pseudo-randomly drawn from
# Extended Hypergeometric (mA,mB,N, exp(alpha)) distributions with the same set of four alphas.
# That figure shows a clear negatively sloped relationshiop between
# Affinity and Number of Occupied sites, but still shows some artifactual curvature
# because of the very restricted range of Affinity values in the examples generated with
# largest and smallest numbers of occupied sites. But note that all of these figures would not be said
# to exhibit curvatures if the points with largest and smallest numbers of occupied sites were excluded from the dataset.
